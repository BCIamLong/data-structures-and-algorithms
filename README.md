## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Javascript language. The goal is to provide clear and efficient implementations along with examples, challenges to help understand how they work.

## Data Structures

### Array

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array.

### Hash Tables

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (we will call it a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node.

### Stacks

A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

### Queues

A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.

### Trees

A tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

### Graphs

A graph is a data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting them. Graphs are used to represent pairwise relations between objects.

## Algorithms

### Recursion

Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code.

### Sorting

Sorting is the process of arranging data in a particular order (either ascending or descending). Sorting algorithms are fundamental and widely used in various applications. Some of the most common sorting algorithms include:

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison-based algorithm where the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the beginning and the unsorted part, and repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into the correct position.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.
- **Heap Sort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.
